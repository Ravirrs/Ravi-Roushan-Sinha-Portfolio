          <h1>What's CSS</h1>
          <small>December, 2022</small>
          <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It is a crucial part of web development, as it allows developers to separate the content of a website (written in HTML) from its presentation (defined by CSS). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update websites, as changes to the style can be made in a single location rather than having to modify the HTML of each page individually.

            CSS consists of a set of rules that dictate how elements on a webpage should be styled. These rules consist of a selector, which specifies the elements to which the rule should be applied, and a declaration, which defines the style that should be applied to the selected elements. For example, the following rule sets the color of all paragraphs on a webpage to red:
            
           
            p {
              color: red;
            }


            In this example, "p" is the selector and "color: red" is the declaration. The declaration is made up of a property (in this case, "color") and a value (in this case, "red"). There can be multiple declarations within a single rule, separated by semicolons.
            
            CSS also has a concept of specificity, which determines which rules will be applied to an element if there are multiple rules that could apply. The more specific a rule is, the more weight it has and the more likely it is to be applied. For example, a rule that targets a specific element (such as "p") will have more specificity than a rule that targets all elements (such as "*").
            
            CSS also has various units of measurement that can be used to specify the size and dimensions of elements. These units include pixels (px), ems, and percentages. Pixels and ems are fixed units, while percentages are relative to the size of the parent element.
            
            CSS has come a long way since its inception and now includes various features such as responsive design, which allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, and the use of preprocessors, which allow developers to use variables and other advanced features to make writing CSS more efficient.
            
            In summary, CSS is an essential part of web development that allows developers to control the look and feel of their websites. It is a powerful tool that has evolved significantly over the years and will continue to play a crucial role in the development of the web.

          <h1>Web accessibility</h1>
          <small>December, 2022</small>
          <p>
               Web accessibility refers to the practice of making websites and web applications accessible to people with disabilities. This includes individuals with visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological disabilities, as well as those who may have temporary or situational impairments, such as a broken arm or being in a noisy environment.

              Web accessibility involves ensuring that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and web applications. This includes providing alternatives for users who may not be able to see, hear, or use a mouse, as well as ensuring that websites are easy to use and navigate for all users, regardless of their ability.

              There are several guidelines and standards that have been developed to ensure web accessibility. These guidelines outline specific requirements for making websites and web applications accessible, such as providing alt text for images, using clear and descriptive headings, and providing text alternatives for non-text content.

              Implementing web accessibility is important because it allows people with disabilities to access the same information and services as everyone else. It also benefits businesses and organizations by increasing the potential customer base and improving the user experience for all users.

              To ensure web accessibility, developers should follow best practices and guidelines, test their websites and web applications for accessibility, and involve users with disabilities in the design and testing process. By making the web accessible to everyone, we can create a more inclusive and equitable online environment.
